    <h5>Exercise P7.1 from the textbook</h5>
    <p>Implement a class <b>Person</b> with the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the name</li>
        <li>a pointer to the person's best friend (a Person*)</li>
        <li>a popularity counter that indicates how many other people have this person as their best friend</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Write a program that reads in a list of names, allocates a <b>new Person</b> for each of them, and stores them in a <b>vector&#60;Person*&#62;</b>. Then ask the name of the best friend for each of the <b>Person</b> objects. Locate the object matching the friend's name and call a <b>set_best_friend</b> member function to update the pointer and counter. Finally, print out all <b>Person</b> objects, listing the name, best friend, and popularity counter for each.</p>
